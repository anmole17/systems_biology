#The equations for the rate of change of ATP and glucose in the cell are as follows:
  # d[ATP]/dt=2*K1*[G]*[ATP]-((Kp*[ATP])/([ATP]+Km))
  # d[G]/dt = Vin âˆ’ K1*[G]*[ATP]
  # The parameter values for the model are the following:
  # V in = 0.36, k 1 = 0.02, K p = 6 and K m = 13.
  # The concentrations of glucose and ATP were 6.6 and 7.6 units, respectively.
  # (a) Write a R code to simulate the system behaviour till 1000 mins of the reaction.
  # (b) Show the time profiles of Glucose and ATP concentrations in the same plot. Interpret
  # the results.
  # (c) Change the value of Km to 20. Run the simulation. What difference do you observe
  # between both the systems?
