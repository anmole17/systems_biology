# An infectious disease model consists of the following variables:
# S(t) = number of susceptible individuals at time t
# I(t) = number of infectious individuals at time t
# R(t) = number of individuals died at time t
# with N(t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = total number of individuals = constant
# This model (called â€™SIR model) is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations,
# dS/dt = (-b*S*I)/N
# dI/dt = (b*S*I)/N - (c*I)
# dR/dt = c*I
# Solve the above equation in R for b= 2, c=0.2 with the initial conditions :
# S(0) = 99, I(0) = 1 and R(0) = 0
# with the condition that
# Plot the three variables S, I and R as a function of time on the same graph. Interpret the
#results.
